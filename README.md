## Hi there 👋

I’m excited to share that I earned the **AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty** certification!

## 🧭 Why This Certification?

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I’ve built and deployed models across domains like:

- Audio and speech recognition (e.g., wav2vec, Whisper, DeepSpeech)
- Natural Language Processing with GPT-style models
- Gait-based emotion recognition using CNN-RNN hybrids

This certification validated my ability to **design and deploy ML solutions using AWS**, ensuring scalability, cost-efficiency, and performance.
